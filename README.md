# **Story Adventure**

## Project Notes: 02/18/2025 ##

> Update 2: So, I figured out the direction. We're going with a
> narration driven story adventure you can play in one sitting. 
> That avoids the save state issue and heavy coding I don't have
> time for in a side project. 

***General Ideas***
- Randomize the story OR Randomize the encounters
- Randomize the story AND Randomize the encounters
- Just start coding and see where it goes (leaning into
- this one hard)
>
> Update 1: Shelved previous project (Random Adventure) to start
> fresh - realized before I started going nuts I needed to work on
> how to code save states so the game did not need to be completed
> in one sitting. First push is probably going to be a hot mess of
> ideas with zero direction.  I've yet to code anything yet.
