# **Story Adventure**

## Project Notes: 02/22/2025 ##
> It's been a wild couple days preventing me from working on the project
> however, I've made up for lost time tonight. <br> <br>
> I've finished all the pre-game set up. Player naming and initial stats are 
> done for now unless changes are made later. In doing this I've added classes
> for armor and weapon bonuses. <br> <br>
> I've added a function to display hero stats and another for a generic loading
> bar just to give the player time to fully read the screen before a clear happens. 
> I updated the intro screen/narration in the process. I'm a lot happier with the
> opening. <br> <br>
> ***Next Step:*** Begin working on chapter one.  This is going to involve creating
> classes for mobs. I'm shooting for 3 chapters just so the game stays playable in
> one sitting. Overall really happy with today's work. Hold on to that energy.

> Update 2: So, I figured out the direction. We're going with a
> narration driven story adventure you can play in one sitting. 
> That avoids the save state issue and heavy coding I don't have
> time for in a side project. 

***General Ideas***
- Randomize the story OR Randomize the encounters
- Randomize the story AND Randomize the encounters
- Just start coding and see where it goes (leaning into
- this one hard)

> Update 1: Shelved previous project (Random Adventure) to start
> fresh - realized before I started going nuts I needed to work on
> how to code save states so the game did not need to be completed
> in one sitting. First push is probably going to be a hot mess of
> ideas with zero direction.  I've yet to code anything yet.
